    "* Functions\n",
    "    * What are they?\n",
    "    * How do we define them?\n",
    "    * Why are they useful?\n",
    "    * Types of argument\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Using Python packages\n",
    "    * What is a package?\n",

    "    * How to load them and use functions from them \n",

    "    * How do we use real data to produce these plots?\n",

    "We will also cover three more advanced topics. While not strictly necessary for the work we will be doing, these topics are very useful for further study in Python, and will make data handling much easier if you learn how to apply them correctly.\n",
