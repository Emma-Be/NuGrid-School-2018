1. How can I continue to use the tools taught in this schoolâ€™s afternoon session?
   - Day 1: Analysis of NuGrid data sets will continue to be available through wendi.nugridstars.org (always go there to get the current link to operational server)
   - Day 2: one-zone ppn simulations will continue to be available on wendi server 
      * again: go there via wendi.nugridstars.org) and we will for the time being not delete your directoriesonce you get results you think are real it is advised that you get in touch with NuGrid members who can help you check everything; this is stongly advised; you must not publish results obtained with NuGrid's PPN codes without checking in with a NuGrid member.
      * you are free to use the code on wendi but you are not supposed to download the code from here and use it elsewhere.
      * there are plans to make ppn open source some time in the future.
   - Day 3: GCE tools can be executed on wendi, or download NuPyCEE from github and use on your own computer.
